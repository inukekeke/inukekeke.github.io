                <h2>üé• My Top 10 favorite movies of all time :p</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li onclick="toggleDescription('desc1')" class="clickable">Fight Club (1999) ü•á</li>
                    <p id="desc1" class="description">Obviously number one on many lists and widely regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time, this is my personal favorite out of all the
                        movies I‚Äôve watched. Despite watching it for the first time relatively late and knowing the main plot twist beforehand, I was still unprepared, and the reveal caught me off
                        guard, as well as the final act set to the music of the Pixies. A mind-bending movie fully deserving of this first place.</p>
                    <li onclick="toggleDescription('desc2')" class="clickable">12 Angry Men (1957) ü•à</li>
                    <p id="desc2" class="description">I was (happily) surprised to see this movie rated this high by the public a long time after watching it for the first time. I personally watched
                        it in high school with a top-notch English literature teacher who shared some really good movies and books with us. In short, this movie changed my life and my way of thinking.
                        It is so intense, with many dramatic key moments, and watching this movie is such an immersive experience; you really get to be with the twelve jurors all movie long, and at
                        one moment or another, you‚Äôre eventually going to be convinced by juror #8 (wonderfully played by Henry Fonda). 10/10 would recommend for EVERYONE to see.</p>
                    <li onclick="toggleDescription('desc3')" class="clickable">Troy (2004) ü•â</li>
                    <p id="desc3" class="description">Myeah‚Ä¶ 2 hours and 43 minutes of Brad Pitt as Achilles in an epic adaptation of the Iliad and Posthomerica? Of course, I‚Äôm going to like it.
                        Amazing acting from him, and despite the criticisms this movie has largely faced, it‚Äôs still a film I regularly watch and enjoy. Its placement on this list is purely personal,
                        and I understand that some may not agree with it.</p>
                    <li onclick="toggleDescription('desc4')" class="clickable">Inglourious Basterds (2009)</li>
                    <p id="desc4" class="description">Christoph Waltz‚Ä¶ What a performance from him... But not only him! This movie is a pure masterpiece in terms of tension, relief, tension, relief;
                        it is so perfectly executed, and every scene is so intense. Tarantino has rightfully earned his reputation. Amazing performance from the French actress M√©lanie Laurent as well.
                    </p>
                    <li onclick="toggleDescription('desc5')" class="clickable">Spirited Away (2001)</li>
                    <p id="desc5" class="description">The only animated movie on this list, it‚Äôs my favorite Ghibli and a film that someone I really loved shared with me. Two hours of adventurous
                        twists and turns, with lovely characters in Chihiro, Haku, No-Face, and Yubaba, along with all the subtexts and metaphors in this movie. In addition to that, just like the
                        other Ghibli films, this movie doesn‚Äôt age with time; after 24 years it‚Äôs still artistically beautiful.</p>

                <h2>I LOVE MAGI</h2>
                <p>PLEASE read (or watch) Magi. It's my all-time favorite manga by far. It has amazing characters, like <i>(oh god this is going to be long)</i> Aladdin, Alibaba, Morgiana, Sinbad,
                    Ja'far, Masrur, Yamraiha, Hakuryuu, Kougyoku, Kouha, Kouen, Muu, Titus, Scheherazade, Cassim, Dunya, Yunan, Judar, Ithnan, Ugo, Arba, Solomon, Sheba, David, and many more. They all
                    experience character development throughout the series; you will love them and hate them at least once (They're also ALL so hot üò≥). It is a Sh≈çnen but it deals with more serious topics, such as types of
                    government (democracy, monarchy...), morals surrounding slavery, and whether fate is a fatality.<br>(also sinbad solos any of your favorite characters)</p>
